So, my love, I hope you enjoy yourself on this particular day, and I wish the very best for my princess. I love you, Ava.





I feel soon

I will sink

Into you

What do you think?

'Cause there's still blood

In your hair
  
Got the bruise
  
Of the year

But it's something about her

Long shady eyes

I'm all about her

Shade tonight
                          
I hate your tattoos

You have weak wrists

But I'll keep you

'Cause it's something about her

Long shady eyes

I'm all about her 

Shade tonight

Well it's too bad

It's too bad

It's too bad

You're married, to me

Me and you. I will always be here with you no matter what, and I promise to love and care for you for eternity, my love. I love you so much.





I'm yours.

Now,

tomorrow,

forever.

There will never be a day when I don't love you more than life itself.
