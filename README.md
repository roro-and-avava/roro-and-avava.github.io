I feel soon

I will sink

Into you

What do you think?

'Cause there's still blood

In your hair

Got the bruise

Of the year

But it's something about her

Long shady eyes

I'm all about her

Shade tonight

I hate your tattoos

You have weak wrists

But I'll keep you

'Cause it's something about her

Long shady eyes

I'm all about her

Shade tonight

Well it's too bad

It's too bad

It's too bad

You're married, to me
