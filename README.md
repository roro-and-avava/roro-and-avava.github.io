I love you so much, Ava, and you mean everything to me. Happy Birthday to the most perfect person, and I am forever grateful to be with you. I want you to know how much you mean to me on this special day. Our love has brought boundless joy and happiness into my life, and I love every moment we have shared. You have a light that brightens my darkest days.

A voice and laugh that warms my heart and a love that completes me. As we celebrate this occasion, I want to remind you of all the incredible qualities that make you perfect. Your kindness, compassion, humour, personality, loyalty and grace inspire me to be the best person I could possibly be. On your birthday, I wish all your dreams come true, and that our future is filled with success and happiness. 

Our love grows stronger with each passing day. You are my girlfriend, best friend, soulmate and greatest blessing. I cherish all our moments together and cannot wait for the many more ahead. So, my love, I hope you enjoy yourself on this particular day, and I wish the very best for my princess. I love you, Ava.





I feel soon

I will sink

Into you

What do you think?

'Cause there's still blood

In your hair

Got the bruise

Of the year

But it's something about her

Long shady eyes

I'm all about her

Shade tonight

I hate your tattoos

You have weak wrists

But I'll keep you

'Cause it's something about her

Long shady eyes

I'm all about her

Shade tonight

Well it's too bad

It's too bad

It's too bad

You're married, to me

Us. I will always be here with you no matter what, and I promise to love and care for you for eternity, my love. I love you so much.
