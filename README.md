o 
I love you so much, Ava, and you mean everything to me. Happy Birthday to the most perfect person, and I am forever grateful to be with you. I want you to know how much you mean to me on this special day. Our love has brought boundless joy and happiness into my life, and I love every moment we have shared. You have a light that brightens my darkest days.

A voice and laugh that warms my heart and a love that completes me. As we celebrate this occasion, I want to remind you of all the incredible qualities that make you perfect. Your kindness, compassion, humour, personality, loyalty and grace inspire me to be the best person I could possibly be. On your birthday, I wish all your dreams come true, and that our future is filled with success and happiness. 

Our love grows stronger with each passing day. You are my girlfriend, best friend, soulmate and greatest blessing. I cherish all our moments together and cannot wait for the many more ahead. So, my love, I hope you enjoy yourself on this particular day, and I wish the very best for my princess. I love you, Ava.





                        I feel soon

                          I will sink

                            Into you

                              What do you think?

                                'Cause there's still blood

                                  In your hair
  
                                    Got the bruise
  
                                      Of the year

                                        But it's something about her

                                          Long shady eyes

                                            I'm all about her

                                              Shade tonight
                          
                                                I hate your tattoos

                                                  You have weak wrists

                                                    But I'll keep you

                                                      'Cause it's something about her

                                                        Long shady eyes

                                                          I'm all about her 

                                                            Shade tonight

                                                              Well it's too bad

                                                                It's too bad

                                                                  It's too bad

                                                                    You're married, to me
